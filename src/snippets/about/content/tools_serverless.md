To reach an high level of performance and security we prefer a serverless approach. Thus we use different cloud solutions like !Icon[github](){} Github Pages, !Icon[netlify](){} Netlify, !Icon[aws]() Amazon AWS, !Icon[google]() Google Cloud, etc. to provide an fast and easy to maintain product. For backend services we provide lambda functions based on Go, !Icon[node-js]() Node.js and !Icon[python]() Python.
