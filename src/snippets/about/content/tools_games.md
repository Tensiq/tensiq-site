After using different kind of game development tools and environments we fell in love with the awesome !Icon[godot](){} Godot Engine. It is a compact open source C++ game engine with a custom Python flavored script language called GDScript. Via different export templates it targets most of the needed platforms. Because of it's open source nature it is fully extensible and the MIT licence supports a completely free commercial usage.
