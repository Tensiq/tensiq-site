We live on !Icon[windows](){} Windows, !Icon[apple](){} Mac OSX and Linux operating systems and do our coding in Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text and neovim thru tmux on Linux systems. We chose the environment that fits best and share our source code via git on !Icon[github](){} Github or Gitea as local replacement.
